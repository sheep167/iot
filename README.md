# IOT-Server-Dashboard
This project uses `Flask` as backend, `MongoDB`as Database and `React` as frontend.
<br>
The backend provides API support, including user authentication with `JWT token`.
The frontend serves as a simple gui so as to show the realtime data.

<h2> Getting Started </h2>
The backend assumes there is a running `MongoDB` in localhost.
<br>
Front-end: Navigate to directory &rarr; `yarn` &rarr; `yarn start`
<br>
Back-end: Navigate to directory &rarr; `pip install -r requirements.txt` &rarr; `python main.py`
<br>
Now the two server should be running on port `3000` and `5000`.
